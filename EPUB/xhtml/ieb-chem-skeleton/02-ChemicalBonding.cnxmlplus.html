        <h1>Chemical bonding</h1>
<h2>Intramolecular Bonds</h2>
<div class="teachers-guide"><ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>
	      
<p>Define an intramolecular bond as occurring between atoms within molecules.</p>

	    </li>
<li>
	      
<p>Define electronegativity as <em>a measure of the tendency of an atom to attract a bonding pair of electrons</em>.</p>

	    </li>
<li>
	      
<p>Define a covalent bond as <em>a sharing of at least one pair of electrons by two atoms</em>.</p>

	      <ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>
		  
<p>Non-polar covalent (pure covalent) is an <em>equal sharing of electrons</em>.</p>

		</li>
<li>
		  
<p>Polar covalent is <em>unequal sharing of electrons leading to a dipole forming</em> (as a result of electronegativity difference).</p>

		</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
	      
<p>Define an ionic bond as <em>a transfer of electrons and subsequent electrostatic attraction</em>.</p>

	    </li>
<li>
	      
<p>Define metallic bonding as <em>being between a positive kernel and a sea of delocalised electrons</em>.</p>

	    </li>
<li>
	      
<p>In giant structures such as diamond, graphite and silicon dioxide melting and boiling points are high due to strong covalent bonds being broken.</p>

	    </li>
<li>
	      
<p>Identify that in giant ionic solids (e.g. sodium chloride), the melting points and boiling points are determined by electrostatic forces of attraction (ionic bonds) between the cations and the anions in the lattice structure.</p>

	    </li>
</ul></div><h2>Intermolecular forces</h2>
<div class="teachers-guide"><ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>
	      
<p>Identify that in a liquid or a solid there must be forces between the molecules causing them to be attracted to one another, otherwise the molecules would move apart and become a gas.</p>

	    </li>
<li>
	      
<p>Define intermolecular force as <em>a weak force of attraction between molecules or between atoms of noble gases</em>.</p>

	    </li>
<li>
	      
<p>Distinguish between intermolecular forces and intramolecular bonds.</p>

	    </li>
<li>
	      
<p>Name and explain the origin of the different intermolecular forces:</p>

	      <ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>
		  
<p>Van der Waals forces:</p>

		  <ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>
		      
<p>dipole-dipole</p>

		    </li>
<li>
		      
<p>ion-dipole</p>

		    </li>
<li>
		      
<p>induced dipole (London forces)</p>

		    </li>
</ol></li>
<li>
		  
<p>Hydrogen bonding as a special case of dipole-dipole forces.</p>

		</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
	      
<p>Identify that within simple molecular substances the melting point and boiling point are affected by the strength (influenced by number of electrons and polarity of molecule) and the relative number of the intermolecular forces.</p>

	    </li>
