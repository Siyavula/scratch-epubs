<h2>Energy changes in reactions (exothermic and endothermic reactions)</h2>
<div class="teachers-guide"><ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>
	      
<p>Define heat of reaction (<math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">\Delta\text{H}</annotation></semantics></math>) as <em>as the net change of chemical potential energy of the system</em>.</p>

	    </li>
<li>
	      
<p>Define exothermic reactions as <em>reactions which transfer potential energy into thermal energy</em>.</p>

	    </li>
<li>
	      
<p>Define endothermic reactions as <em>reactions which transfer thermal energy into potential energy</em>.</p>

	    </li>
<li>
	      
<p>Identify that bond breaking is endothermic and that bond formation is exothermic. No calculations will be required.</p>

	    </li>
<li>
	      
<p>Identify that a stronger bond requires more energy to break and releases more energy when formed.</p>

</ul></div><h2>Activation energy</h2>
<div class="teachers-guide"><ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>
	      
<p>Define activation energy as <em>the minimum energy required to start a chemical reaction</em>. Colliding molecules must have, apart from the correct orientation, a kinetic energy equal to or bigger than the activation energy of a reaction before the reaction can take place.</p>

	    </li>
<li>
	      
<p>Define the activated complex as <em>a temporary transition state between the reactants and the products</em>.</p>

	    </li>
<li>
	      
<p>Draw free hand potential energy profile graphs of endothermic reactions and exothermic reactions (with reactants, products, activation energy, activated complex and <math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">\Delta\text{H}</annotation></semantics></math> labelled).</p>

	    </li>
</ul></div><h2>Rates of reaction</h2>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>(a) <strong>Rates of Reaction and Factors Affecting Rate</strong></p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>
	      
<p>Define reaction rate as <em>the change in concentration per unit time of either a reactant or product</em>.</p>

	    </li>
<li>
	      
<p>List the factors which affect the rate of chemical reactions. (Nature of reacting substances, surface area (solid), concentration (solution), pressure (gas), temperature and catalyst).</p>

	    </li>
<li>
	      
<p>Explain in terms of collision theory how the various factors affect the rate of chemical reactions.</p>

	    </li>
<li>
	      
<p>Use a Maxwell Boltzmann distribution curve showing the distribution of molecular energies (number of particles against their kinetic energy) to explain why only some molecules have enough energy to react and hence how heating the reactants affects the rate.</p>

	    </li>
</ul><p>(b) <strong>Measuring Rates of Reaction</strong></p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>
	      
<p>Suggest suitable experimental techniques for measuring the rate of a given reaction including the measuring of gas volumes, turbidity (e.g. precipitate formation), change of colour and the change of the mass of the reaction vessel.</p>

	    </li>
</ul><p>(c) <strong>Effect of a Catalyst</strong></p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>
	      
<p>Define a catalyst as <em>a substance that increases the rate of the reaction but remains unchanged at the end of the reaction</em>.</p>

	    </li>
<li>
	      
<p>Explain (in simple terms) how some catalysts function by interacting with the reactants in such a way that the reaction follows an alternative path of lower activation energy.</p>

	    </li>
<li>
	      
<p>Use any suitable graph (including e.g. Energy profile graph, Maxwell Boltzmann distribution curve, rate vs time or quantity vs time) to show how adding a catalyst affects the rate of reaction.</p>
